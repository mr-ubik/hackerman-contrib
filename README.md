Code like it's the 80s again.

Synthwave, Neon Lights, Fast Car.

Inspired by the retrofuturist aestethics of the 80s, Neuromancer and neon lights.
Hackerman Syntax has a dark background with bright neon colors highlighting the code in order to achieve maximum readability.

I am currently seeking feedback on both the choice of colors and the implementations.

Happy Coding!
